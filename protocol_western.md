Protocol for Western Blot Using CST Kit
=======================================

# Notes:
- combination of CST protocol for the kit #12957 and notes from their videos
- Requires an overnight incubation

# Protein Blotting
1. Aspirate culture media from cells in culture
2. Lyse cells by one of three methods:

   a. 1X Cell Lysis Buffer
      - 80 mcL/well of 6-well plate or 400 mcL for 10 cm plate
      - Incubate on ice x 5 minutes
      - Scrape cells off the plate into a microcentrifuge tube and keep on ice
      - Sonicate for 10--15 seconds and then keep on ice
      - Centrifuge for 10 minutes at 14,000 x g in cold centrifuge
      - Transfer supernatant to new microcentrifuge tube, discard pellet
      - Determine protein concentration using BCA Assay (see separate protocol)
      
   b. 1X SDS sample buffer 
      - 100 mcL per well of 6-well plate or 500 mcL for 10 cm plate
      - Immediately scrape cells off the plate into a microcentrifuge tube and keep on ice
      - Sonicate for 10--15 seconds and then keep on ice
      - Heat a 20 mcL sample to 95--100 C for minutes and then cool on ice
      - Microcentrifuge for 5 minutes
      
3. Prepare electrophoresis gell and aparatus using 1X running buffer

4. Load Gel
   - Load 15 mcL of sample onto the SDS-PAGE gel 
   - Load Prestained protein markers to verify electrotransfer
   - Load biotinylated protein ladder to determine molecular weights (if have)
   
5. Perform SDS-PAGE

# Electrotransfer to Nitrocellulose Membrane
- Use wet transfer cassette in 1X transfer buffer
- Order: wet sponge, filter paper, gel, nitrocellulose membrane, filter paper, wet sponge
- remove air bubbleand insert in proper direction in transfer apparatus
- transfer under cooling conditions at 70 volts for 1.5 - 3 hours
