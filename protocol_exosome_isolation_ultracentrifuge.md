Exosome Isolation - Ultracentrifugation
=======================================

# Protocol Notes [^1] DRAFT

-   This protocol was originally modified from Thery2006, then modified after Laesser2012 and most recently updated to reflect findings in Cvjetkovic2014 reflecting changes in centrifuge rotors and lab equipment.

-   This protocol is suitable for serum, BALF, and most other biological fluids.

-   If used in medium, FCS must be exosome free. FCS can be replaced with insulin-transferrin-sodium-selenite supplement or BSA (1% w/v) if desired (Thery2002)

-   Threads of ultracentrifuge buckets must be coated with Beckman Spinkote, and the gaskets must be coated with Beckman Vacuum grease.

-   Must refrigerate 45 Ti rotor buckets at 4 degrees C prior to running.

-   Spins are programmed into the L-70k centrifuge for ease of use. Please see page 3-2 of the manual for Programmed Usage.

### Biohazard Safety

-    Be sure to work in a biohazard safety cabinet at all times. Wipe the cabinet before and after use with 70% ethanol or Bacdown disinfectant. 
-    Use universal biosafety precautions, wear a lab coat and disposable gloves, and other appropriate PPE.
-    When disposing BAL fluids, add bleach to the discarded fluid for 10% bleach solution to disinfect the cells and fluid at least 10 minutes, then discard and rinse down the drain. 
-    While spinning in centrifuge, cover the samples with the "Biohazard" caps to prevent the spread of infectious content in the case of a spill. 
-    Dispose trash in the designated "Biohazard" trashcans. Be sure to double bag the pipets before disposal.

# Methods

1.  If sample has not yet been centrifuged to remove cells, then centrifuge sample in 50-mL conical tube at 300*g in the Sorval Legend XTR centrifuge for 10 minutes at 4 degrees C.
    1.  This is saved as Program 2 on the Sorval Legend XTR centrifuge
	2.  *Supernatant* after this step contains the exosomes.

2.  Using a serological pipet, remove the supernatant to approximately 2 cm above pellet. Use a pipetman to remove as much remaining supernatant as possible without disturbing the pellet. Transfer supernatant to ultracentrifuge tubes.
    1.  Optional: Keep aliquot of supernatant for purification analysis if necessary.

3.  Balance ultracentrifuge tubes with cold PBS using a scale.
    1.  Fill tubes leaving only a few millimeters of empty space.
    2.  Tubes must be weighed within 0.1 – 0.2 g of each other

4.  Spin samples in ultracentrifuge, 16,500*g (14,500 RPM with 45 Ti) for 25 minutes at 4 degrees C.
    1.  This is saved as Program 4 on the Optima L-70k Ultracentrifuge
    2.  *Supernatant* after this step contains the exosomes.

5.  Use serological pipet to remove supernatant from each tube, again being careful not to disturb the pellet.

6.  Transfer to a 60 mL sterile syringe and filter through 0.22 micron cellulose acetate membrane filter.

6.  Transfer supernatant into new ultracentrifuge tubes and replace back in swing buckets. Be sure to lightly re-grease threads of buckets.
    1.  Optional: Keep an aliquot of supernatant for purification analysis if desired.

6.  Balance tubes with cold PBS as in step 3.

7.  Spin in ultracentrifuge 118,000*g (39,000 RPM with 45 Ti) for 5 hours at 4 degrees C.
    1.  Requires a *delayed* start in the Ultracentrifuge, timed to complete the spin in the morning when processing can be immediately continued. The holding temperature should be set at 4 degrees C.
	2.  The spun pellet cannot sit in the ultracentrifuge for long prior to continuing with processing.
    3.  *Pellet* after this step contains exosomes.

7.	_Alternative:_ If not able to complete processing in the AM which is required by the overnight spin, then spin in ultracentrifuge 118,000*g (39,000 RPM with 45 Ti) for 1.5 hours at 4 degrees C.
    1.  This is saved as Program 2 on the Optima L-70k Ultracentrifuge
    2.  *Pellet* after this step contains exosomes
	3.  Overnight, longer spin is much preferred due to increased yields

<!-- 8.  Use a serological pipet to remove the supernatant from the -->
<!--     samples. Use a pipetman to remove as much supernatant from the -->
<!--     pellet as possible without disturbing it. -->
<!--     1.  Optional: Keep an aliquot of supernatant for purification -->
<!--         analysis if desired. -->

<!-- 9.  Using cold PBS, condense all pellets from same sample into a clean -->
<!--     ultracentrifuge tube and fill up the tube to near maximum volume. -->

<!-- 10. Balance sample tube with another tube filled with PBS. -->
<!--     1.  All swing buckets with screwcaps must be attached to the rotor -->
<!--         whether or not they contain sample. -->

<!-- 11. Spin in ultracentrifuge, 110,000xg (25,000 RPM with SW 41 Ti) for -->
<!--     1 hour at 4 degrees C. -->
<!--     1. This is Program 3 on the Optima L-70k Ultracentrifuge -->
<!--     2.  Pellet after this step contains the exosomes. -->

12. Again, use a serological pipet to remove the supernatant from the samples. Use a pipetman to remove as much supernatant from the pellet as possible. Resuspend pellet in 60-120 mcL of PBS and store at -80 degrees C.
    1.  Optional: If you want to conduct exosomal protein analysis, you can resuspend in lysis buffer (see BCA protocol).
