============================================================================================================

# Protocol Notes

### Biohazard Safety

-    Be sure to work in a biohazard safety cabinet at all times. Wipe the cabinet before and after use with 70% ethanol or BacDown disinfectant. 
-    Use universal biosafety precautions, wear a barrier resistant lab coat, disposable gloves, and other appropriate PPE.
-    When disposing BAL fluids, add 10% bleach solution to the discarded fluid to disinfect the cells and fluid for at least 10 minutes ("10 for 10"), then discard and rinse down the drain. 
-    Dispose of trash in the designated "Biohazard" trash cans. Be sure to double bag the pipets before disposal. 


# Materials:

1. 15 mL polystyrene conical tubes
2. 50 mL polystyrene conical tubes
3. 5 mL polystyrene tubes with caps
5. Incubator (37C/5% CO2)
6. Growth Medium
   - Serum-Free Media (SFM), Location: refrigerator #6
   - Exosome-Free Media (EFM), Location: refrigerator #6
11. QIAzol 
   - Location: Middle shelf, in between the biosafety cabinets, or in 4C
12. TNF-alpha human at 5 ng/mcL
   - Location: Freezer #3, -20C, box #7

# Methods:

## Day 1:

1. Begin with 95% confluent A549 cells in appropriate sized container with EFM
2. Using 6-well culture plates
   1. Each well holds 2 mL of culture media
   2. Replace the exosome-free media (EFM) with serum-free media (SFM) in each well
   3. Incubate overnight at 37C/5% CO2

## Day 2:
1. Using 6-well culture plates 
   1. Prepare TNF-alpha stimulation media
      1.  Desired final TNF-alpha concentration of 10 ng/mL. Need 4 mcL of the TNF-alpha (5 ng/mcL stock concentration) per well (2 mL of media/well)
      2. For _each_ 6-well _plate_ combine to make a master mix:
	    -  12 mcL TNF-alpha stock, and 
	    -  6 mL serum-free media (SFM)
	  
   2. Add 2 mL of stimulation media to each _stimulation_ well
   3. Add 2 mL of serum-free media (SFM) to each _control_ well
   4. _Incubate_ at 37C/5% CO2 for _4 hours_
   5. Remove supernatant for exosome isolation
   6. Add 1 mL of TRIzol/QIAzol to each well and incubate at RT for five minutes
   7. Gently wash about the TRIzol in each well
   8. Remove the TRIzol mixture and place each well into a separate 5 mL polystyrene tube and cap
   9. Place TRIzol tubes into the -80C freezer for later RNA extraction or proceed immediately to RNA extraction. 
   10. *Alternatively* if processing RNA with a kit, then add only 700 mL of TRIzol or QIAzol to each well

## RNA Extraction - Slav's Method
### Phase Separation
1. Incubate specimens for 5 minutes at RT if not already done (thaw if previously frozen)
2. Add 200 mcL of chloroform for each 1 mL of TRIzol Reagent 
3. Cap samples and *shake* vigorously for 15 seconds (do not vortex)
4. Incubate for 3 minutes at RT
5. Centrifuge samples at 12,000xg for 15 minutes at 4C 
   - Sorval Biofuge stratos centrifuge with Heraeus 3332 rotor
6. Mixture will separate into a lower red, phenol-chloroform phase, an interphase, and a colorless upper aqueous phase

### RNA Precipitation
1. Transfer the aqueous phase into a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube, care not to get any interface
2. Add 500 mcL of isopropyl alcohol (per 1 mL of TRIzol Reagent used initially) to precipitate RNA
3. Mix by gently inverting 10 times

### RNA Wash
1. Incubate the samples for 10 minutes at RT
2. Centrifuge at 12,000xg for 10 minutest at 10C
3. Discard supernatant
4. Wash RNA pellet *twice* with 1 mL of 75% EtOH / 25% DPEC (stock see above)
   - Briefly vortex or flick to tube to mix
   - Centrifuge at 12,000xg for 5 minutes at 4C
   - Remove residuals of wash with pipette carefully, trying not to disturb the pellet
   - Samples can be stored for up to one year at -20C in this mixture
5. Pipette off any excess EtOH, carelly so as not to disturb the pellet, which should be visible at the side of the tube
6. Centrifuge again without adding any further wash solution at 12,000xg for 5 minutes at 4C
7. Remove any excess wash buffer. 
   - If not enough EtOH evaporates, this will prevent the RNA from going into solution moving forward
8. Air dry the samples by leaving the cap off on the bench for 5-10 minutes at RT
9. Resuspend in 30 mcL of DPEC (RNAse-free water) by pipetting up and down or heating for 10 minutes at 55-60C 
9. Use Nanodrop (RNA settings) to calculate RNA concentrations
   - See separate protocol
10. Store samples at -80C
