# Methods:
## BCA Protein Assay
1.	Prepare BSA standards using PBS as a diluent
    a.	Standard curve range for 1:1 ratio assay is approximately between 10 µg/mL and 200 µg/mL.
    b.	Standard curve range for 1:20 ratio assay is approximately between 200 µg/mL and 8000 µg/mL
    c.	A “0” standard/reference must be made using PBS in place of sample
    d.	Selection of standard curve range depends on the source of the sample
2.	Prepare working reagent
    a.	50 parts reagent A + 1 part reagent B
    b.	Amount of working reagent per tube is 10 µL/tube for 1:1 ratio assay, and 80 µL/tube for 1:20 ratio assay
3.	Aliquot proper volume of standards and samples into PCR tubes
    a.	Volume of standard/sample per tube is 10 µL/tube for 1:1 ratio assay and 4 µL/tube for 1:20 assay
4.	Add proper volume of working reagent to each tube
    a.	Volume of working reagent per tube is 10 µL/tube for 1:1 ratio assay and 80 µL/tube for 1:20 assay
5.	Incubate tubes in PCR thermocycler at 60 degrees C for 30 minutes.
    a.	Program is named “BCA”.
    b.	If evaporation is a problem, incubate tubes at 37 degrees C  for 30 minutes. See additional kit information from Thermo Scientific for full details.
6.	Quantify protein concentration using Nanodrop 1000 BCA program
    a.	Use 2 µL of sample/standard on Nanodrop sensor
    b.	Use water as the blank
    c.	Reference measurement is the “0” standard
    d.	Remember to save standard curve and data in Gregson folder.
