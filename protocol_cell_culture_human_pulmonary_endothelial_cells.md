-	This protocol was modified from:  Sciencell Research Laboratories (catalog # 3000)

# Cell Thawing 
1.	Add 5 ml of Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline, Ca++  and Mg++ free (DPBS, sciencell catalog # 0303) to T-75 flask 
2.	Add 150 µl fibronectin stock solution to flask (Sciencell catalog # 8248)
3.	Leave in incubator overnight 
4.	Prepare medium by adding supplement tube to basal medium. Be sure to use a sterile technique.
5.	Aspirate fibronectin solution and keep in sterile tube. This solution may be used twice. 
6.	Add 20 ml of complete medium to the flask, and go to thaw cells
7.	Thaw cells in 37°C waterbath and dispense into fibronectin treated flask. 
Seeding Density: 5,000 cells/cm² 
8.	After rocking the flask to distribute cells evenly, return flask to incubator and do not disturb for at least 16 hours. 
9.	Change the growth medium the next day to remove DMSO and unattached cells, then every other day thereafter. Cells should be cobblestone or spindle shaped morphology, non-granular cytoplasm, and the cell number will double after 2-3 days in culture. 
# Maintenance 
1.	Change medium every three days until the culture is approximately 70% confluent
2.	Once it reaches 70% confluence, change medium every other day until culture is 90% confluent
# Subculture
1.	Prepare fibronectin coated flasks (2µg/cm²) 
2.	Warm medium, trypsin/ETDA, Trypsin neutralizing solution, and DPBS to room temperature. Do not use 37°C waterbath 
3.	Rinse cells with DPBS
4.	Add 10 ml of DPBS and 2ml of trypsin/ETDA (in T-75 flask) and gently rock the flask until trypsin/ETDA has covered all cells. Incubate flask at 37°C incubator for 1 – 2 minutes or until cells are lifted from the bottom of the flask. 
5.	During incubation, prepare a 50 ml conical tube with 5 ml FBS. Transfer trypsin/ETDA from flask to the conical tube (small percentage of cells will be lifted).
6.	Take flask (with no fluid) and incubate at 37°C for 1 – 2 minutes more.
7.	After trypsinization, turn the flask and tap gently to detach cells from attachment. Check under microscope to determine if cells are detached. 
8.	Add 5 ml of TNS (or medium) to the flask and transfer detached cells to the 50 ml centrifuge tube. Repeat this step. 
9.	Centrifuge 50 ml centrifuge tube at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes. Resuspend cells in growth medium 
10.	Count and plate cells in new fibronectin coated flasks.
