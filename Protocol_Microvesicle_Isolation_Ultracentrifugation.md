#Protocol: Microvesicle Isolation - Ultracentrifugation 
Created by PI on 2014-06-02
Modified by __ on _______

##Notes:

- This protocol is suitable for serum, BALF, and most other biological fluids.
-	Threads of ultracentrifuge buckets must be coated with Beckman Spinkote, and the gaskets must be coated with Beckman Vacuum grease. 
-	Must refrigerate SW 41 Ti rotor buckets at 4 degrees C prior to running.
##Materials:
    1.50-mL polystyrene conical tubes
    2.50mM HEPES buffer, prepared on N/A by N/A, location: stored at 4C temperature in 250-mL glass reagent bottle
    3.Beckman SW 41 Ti rotor, serial# 97U 10110
    4.Beckman SW 41 Ti 104.9 buckets (6)
    5.Beckman Spinkote, Cat# 306812
    6.Beckman Vacuum Grease Silicone, Cat# 335148
    7.Beckman Polyallomer Centrifuge Tubes, 14x89 mm, Lot# Z11208SCA, Reorder# 331374
    8.Jouan CR 412 Centrifuge
    9.Mueller Hinton Broth 
    10.Ice
##Methods:
    1.	Prepare an overnight culture of P. aeruginosa diluted to 103–104 bacteria ml-1 in MHB broth
    2.	Allow to grow at 37 °C for 16–18 h, with shaking at 250 r.p.m
    3.	Spin down sample at 6000xg ( ) for 30 minutes at 4 degrees C.
        a.	Supernatant after this step contains the microvescicles
    4.	Using a serological pipet, remove the supernatant to approximately 2 cm above pellet. Use a pipetman to remove as much remaining supernatant as possible without disturbing the pellet. 
    5.	Transfer to 60mL sterile syringe and filter fluid through 1.0 μm filter followed by 0.22 μm filter to remove particles larger than 200nm.  
    6.	Transfer filtrate into ultracentrifuge tubes. Balance tubes with MHB using a scale.
        a.	Fill tubes leaving only a few millimeters of empty space.
        b.	Tubes must be weighed within 0.1 – 0.2 g
    7.	Spin samples in ultracentrifuge, 150,000xg (35,000 RPM with SW 41 Ti) for 3 hours at 4 degrees C.
        a.	This is saved as Program 7 on the Optima L-70k Ultracentrifuge
        b.	Pellet after this step contains the microvesicles
    8.	Condense pellets using 50 mM HEPES buffer. Transfer into new ultracentrifuge tubes and replace back in swing buckets. Be sure to lightly re-grease threads of buckets.
    9.	Balance tubes with 50mM HEPES buffer.
    10.	Spin in ultracentrifuge 120,000xg (31,000 RPM with SW 41 Ti) for 70 minutes at 4 degrees C.
        a.	This is saved as Program 6 on the Optima L-70k Ultracentrifuge 
        b.	The pellet after this step contains microvesicles
    11.	Again, use a serological pipet to remove the supernatant from the samples. Use a pipetman to remove as much supernatant from the pellet as possible. Condense pellets in 200-400 µL of 50mM HEPES and store at -80 degrees C.
