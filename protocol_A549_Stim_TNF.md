============================================================================================================

Created by AG on 2016-03-01

# Materials:

1. 15 mL polystyrene conical tubes
2. 50 mL polystyrene conical tubes
3. 5 mL polystyrene tubes with caps
5. Incubator (37C/5% CO2)
6. Growth Medium
   a. Serum-Free Media (SFM), Location: refrigerator #6
   a. Exosome-Free Media (EFM), Location: refrigerator #6
11. QIAzol 
   a. Location: Middle shelf, in between the biosafety cabinets, or in 4C
12. TNF-alpha human at 5 ng/mcL
   a. Location: Freezer #3, -20C, box #7

# Methods:

## Day 1:

1. Begin with 95% confluent A549 cells in appropriate sized container with EFM
2. Using 6-well culture plates
   a. Each well holds 2 mL of culture media
   b. Replace the exosome-free media (EFM) with serum-free media (SFM) in each well
   c. Incubate overnight at 37C/5% CO2

## Day 2:
1. Using 6-well culture plates 
   a. Prepare TNF-alpha stimulation media
      i.  Desired final TNF-alpha concentration of 10 ng/mL. Need 4 mcL of the TNF-alpha (5 ng/mcL stock concentration) per well (2 mL of media/well)
	  ii.  For _each_ 6-well _plate_ add:
	    -  12 mcL TNF-alpha stock, and 
		-  6 mL serum-free media (SFM)
	  
   b. Add 2 mL of stimulation media to each _stimulation_ well
   c. Add 2 mL of serum-free media (SFM) to each _control_ well
   d. _Incubate_ at 37C/5% CO2 for _4 hours_
   e. Remove supernatant for exosome isolation
   f. Add 1 mL of TRIzol/QIAzol to each well and incubate at RT for five minutes
   g. Gently wash about the TRIzol in each well
   h. Remove the TRIzol mixture and place each well into a separate 5 mL polystyrene tube and cap
   i. Place TRIzol tubes into the -80C freezer for later RNA extraction or proceed immediately to RNA extraction. 
   j. *Alternatively* if processing RNA with a kit, then add only 700 mL of TRIzol or QIAzol to each well
