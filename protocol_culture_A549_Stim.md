# Methods:

## Day 1:

1. Pipet sufficient volume of HBSS, Trypsin, Serum-Free Media (SFM), and Exosome-Free Media (EFM) into separate 50-ml conical tubes 
   a. HBSS volume: 5 ml for each T-175 flask; 4 ml for each T-75 flask
   b. Trypsin volume: 4 ml for each T-175 flask; 3 ml for each T-75 flask
   c. SFM volume: 12 ml for each T-175 flask; 10 ml for each T-75 flask
2. Place the tubes into 37C/5% CO2 incubator for at least 30 minutes before use.
3. Before splitting, make sure that the A549 cell cultures are 80-90% confluent.
4. Remove the supernatant from each flask.
5. Add appropriate volume of HBSS into each flask. Roll solution back and forth in the flask for 1 minute to wash out the debris.
6. Add appropriate volume of Trypsin into each flask. Roll solution back and forth in the flask to loosen the cells off the surface of the flask. 
7. After agitating, place flask in the incubator. Total trypsinization process should not take longer than 5-7 minutes.
8. Use a cell scraper to completely lift the cells off the surface. Scrape in one direction only (vertically along the width of the flask).
9. Add warm Serum-Free Media (equal to the volume of Trypsin) used to lift the cells to the flask and wash the medium over the complete surface of the flask several times.
10. Pipet cells from the flask into a conical vial and centrifuge at 1200 rpm at 4C for 7 minutes.
11. Remove medium from cells being careful not to disturb the cell pellet. Add appropriate volume of warm Serum-Free Media (10 ml SFM for T-175) and mix well.
12. Add 10-µl of Trypan blue + 10-µl aliquot of cells and mix well. Add 10-µl of the mixture into the Hemocytometer to do a cell count. 
   a. Total number of cells = (average cell count in large squares) * (dilution factor) * (total cell suspension volume) * (10000) 
13. Equally divide up the cells based on how many flasks are going to be used (one flask for each stimulant, and make sure to have one flask for negative control) 
14. Place cells into new flasks and add appropriate volume of Serum-Free Media to starve the cells for 24 hours overnight.

## Day 2:

1. Pipet sufficient Serum-Free Media (SFM) into 50-mL conical tube(s) and place medium in a 37C/5% CO2 incubator for at least 30 minutes before use.
2. Allow stimulant(s) to thaw in RT and then leave on ice. 
   a. TGF-beta (stored in -20C) volume: 2-ul per ml of medium placed in the flask
   b. IL-1beta (stored in -20C) volume: 2-ul per ml of medium placed in the flask
   c. TNF-alpha final concentration 10ng/mL
   c. Other stimulants used: PAMV (stored in -80C) and Exo-AR (stored in -80C)
3. Create growth medium solution(s) by adding appropriate amount of each stimulant to an appropriate volume of Serum-Free Media.
   a. Example: For a T-75 flask, create a solution with 10-ml SFM and 20-µl of TGF-beta.
   b. Example: 6-well plate, 2mL media per well, 12 mL media for three well experiment + 24 mcL TNF-alpha
4. Remove the supernatant from each flask, and add each prepared solution(s) to designated flasks.
5. For the flask designated as the negative control, do not add any stimulants, only add an appropriate volume of Serum-Free Media.
6. Incubate in incubator 37C for four hours.

## Day 4:

1. Pipet sufficient volume of HBSS, Trypsin, and Serum-Free Media (SFM) into separate 50-mL conical tubes.
   a. HBSS volume: 5 ml for each T-175 flask; 4 ml for each T-75 flask
   b. Trypsin volume: 4 ml for each T-175 flask; 3 ml for each T-75 flask
   c. SFM volume: 12 ml for each T-175 flask; 10 ml for each T-75 flask
2. Place all the tubes into a 37C/5% CO2 incubator for at least 30 minutes before use.
3. Remove the supernatant from each flask into separate 15-mL conical tube(s) for Exosome Isolation (refer to Exosome Isolation protocol).
4. Follow steps (5) - (9) from Day 1 to remove the cells from each flask. 
5. Pipet cells from each flask into separate conical tube(s) and centrifuge at 1200 rpm at 4C for 7 minutes.
6. Remove medium from cells being careful not to disturb the cell pellet.
7. Suspend the cell pellet in each conical tube in 700-µl of QIAzol (if using columns) or 1 mL of TRIzol (if not using column extraction for RNA) and mix well. 
8. Transfer the solution into separately labeled 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes for storage at -80C or for RNA extraction (refer to RNeasy Mini Kit protocol). If using 1 mL of TRIzol and not the column extraction, then place in 5mL tubes for freezing.
