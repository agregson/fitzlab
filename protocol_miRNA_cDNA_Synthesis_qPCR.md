Protocol:  miRNA cDNA Synthesis and qPCR 
=========================================
Created by PI on 2012-12-18
# Notes:
-	Protocol has been taken from Genecopoeia ™ AOMD-Q020 user manual
-	When working with RNA, be careful not to contaminate samples with RNases. 
-	Mix all reagents before use
# Materials:
1.	All-in-one miRNA qRT-PCR Reagent kit
2.	MiR-451 Primer (at 2µM)
3.	dd H₂O (RNase and DNase free)
4.	Ice  
# Methods: 
1.	Mix all reverse transcription reagents by flicking and centrifuge before use
2.	Add - Per Reaction:
    Total RNA - 8 µL
    2.5U/µL Poly A polymerase - 1 µL
    RTase Mix - 1 µL
    5X PAP/ RT Buffer - 5 µL
    Spike-in Control - 1 µL
    dd H₂O - 9  µL
        TOTAL: 25 µL
3. Mix and centrifuge. Incubate at 37°C for 60 minutes, 85°C for 5 minutes. You can store cDNA at  -20°C.  Prepare dilutions (5 – 50X) using sterile H₂O before qPCR.
4. Add - Per Reaction: 
    2X All-in-one qPCR Mix - 10 µL
    miRNA qPCR Primer (miR-451) (2 µM) - 2 µL
    Universal Adaptor PCR primer (2 µM) - 2 µL
    First-strand cDNA (diluted 1:5) - 2 µL
    50X ROX Reference Dye - 0.4 µL
    dd H₂O - 3.6 µL
        TOTAL: 20 µL
5.	Use qPCR and program software as follows: 
    a.	Open Step One Software and select “advance settings.”
    b.	Title experiment and save in “ARIC GREGSON” folder
    c.	Select “96 well plate”
    d.	Select “comparative CT”
    e.	Select “SYBR Green.” Make sure the melt curve box is checked
    f.	Select “Standard 2 Hour Run”
    g.	Set up target and samples. Assign to plates.
    h.	Run Methods should be as follows

        Number of Cycles	Step	Temperature	Time
        1	Pre-denature	95°C	10 min
        Denature	95°C	10 sec
        40	Annealing	60°C	20 sec
        Extension	72°C	10 sec
        i.	Melt curve settings should be between 66°C – 95°C
