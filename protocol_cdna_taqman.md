# Notes:

- Protocol has been modified from Taqman Reverse Transcription Reagents 
- Keep all reagents over ice. 
- Determine concentration of RNA beforehand using the Nanodrop (see https://github.com/agregson/fitzlab/blob/protocols/protocol_bca_proteinassay.md)

# Materials:

1. Taqman Reverse Transcription Reagents
   - Applied Biosciences 4304134 
   - Location: refrigerator #1 rm. 231 
2. Thermocycler
3. Ice

# Methods:

1. Prepare the RT reaction mix (per sample, up to 2 mcg of RNA) 

| ADD: | PER REACTION:  | Final Volume |
|:-----|:---------------:|:-----------:|
| 10x buffer | 10 ÂµL | 1x |
|25 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> | 22 mcL | 5.5 mM |
| deoxyNTPs mixture | 20 mcL | 500 mcM |
| Random Hexamers | 5 mcL | 2.5 mcM |
| RNase Inhibitor | 2 mcL | 0.4 U/mcL |
| MultiScribe Reverse Transcriptase (50 U/mcL) | 2.5 mcL | 1.25 U/mcL |
| RNA sample + RNase-free DEPC | 38.5 mcL | 0.25-2.0 mcg |
| Total | 100 | |

2. When trying to make cDNA for more than 1 RNA sample, make the master mix without the RNA beforehand and mix after. Make sure to make enough mastermix to process N+1 RNA samples. (N: number of rna samples)
3. Perform multiple RT reactions if using more tan 2ug of total RNA	
4. Centrifuge the tubes to spin down the contents and eliminate any air bubbles from the solutions
5. Configure the thermocycler with the following conditions (saved as RT). 
6. RT Reaction: 

| Step | Incubation | RT | Enzyme Inactivation | 
|:-----|:----------:|:--:|:-------------------:|
|Time | 10 minutes | 30 min | 5 minutes|
|Temperature | 25 C | 48 C | 95 C |

7. Run the RT program thermal cycler conditions
8. The cDNa may be used immediately for PCR amplification or stored at -15C to -25C for later use
