============================================================================================================

# Protocol Notes

### Biohazard Safety

-    Be sure to work in a biohazard safety cabinet at all times. Wipe the cabinet before and after use with 70% ethanol or BacDown disinfectant. 
-    Use universal biosafety precautions, wear a barrier resistant lab coat, disposable gloves, and other appropriate PPE.
-    When disposing BAL fluids, add 10% bleach solution to the discarded fluid to disinfect the cells and fluid for at least 10 minutes ("10 for 10"), then discard and rinse down the drain. 
-    Dispose of trash in the designated "Biohazard" trash cans. Be sure to double bag the pipets before disposal. 


# Materials:

1. 15 mL polystyrene conical tubes
2. 50 mL polystyrene conical tubes
3. 5 mL polystyrene tubes with caps
5. Incubator (37C/5% CO2)
6. Growth Medium
   - Serum-Free Media (SFM), Location: refrigerator #6
   - Exosome-Free Media (EFM), Location: refrigerator #6
11. QIAzol 
   - Location: Middle shelf, in between the biosafety cabinets, or in 4C
12. TNF-alpha human at 5 ng/mcL
   - Location: Freezer #3, -20C, box #7

# Methods:

## Day 1:

1. Begin with 95% confluent A549 cells in appropriate sized container with EFM
2. Using 6-well culture plates
   1. Each well holds 2 mL of culture media
   2. Replace the exosome-free media (EFM) with serum-free media (SFM) in each well
   3. Incubate overnight at 37C/5% CO2

## Day 2:
1. Using 6-well culture plates 
   1. Prepare TNF-alpha stimulation media
      1.  Desired final TNF-alpha concentration of 10 ng/mL. Need 4 mcL of the TNF-alpha (5 ng/mcL stock concentration) per well (2 mL of media/well)
      2. For _each_ 6-well _plate_ combine to make a master mix:
	    -  12 mcL TNF-alpha stock, and 
	    -  6 mL serum-free media (SFM)
	  
   2. Add 2 mL of stimulation media to each _stimulation_ well
   3. Add 2 mL of serum-free media (SFM) to each _control_ well
   4. _Incubate_ at 37C/5% CO2 for _4 hours_
   5. Remove supernatant for exosome isolation
   6. Add 1 mL of TRIzol/QIAzol to each well and incubate at RT for five minutes
   7. Gently wash about the TRIzol in each well
   8. Remove the TRIzol mixture and place each well into a separate 5 mL polystyrene tube and cap
   9. Place TRIzol tubes into the -80C freezer for later RNA extraction or proceed immediately to RNA extraction. 
   10. *Alternatively* if processing RNA with a kit, then add only 700 mL of TRIzol or QIAzol to each well
