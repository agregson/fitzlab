# Notes:
-	Protocol has been taken from Exiqon miRCURY™ RNA isolation Kit.
-	It is important to work quickly during the whole procedure. 
# Materials:
1.	Exiqon miRCURY™ RNA isolation Kit – Biofluids ( Ref #: 300113, Lot # 1211/001, location rm 231 at room temp)  
2.	100% EtOH
3.	Isopropanol 
4.	Benchtop microcentrifuge
5.	Ice
# Methods:
1.	Add 60 µL Lysis Solution BF to 200 µL sample 
2.	Vortex for 5 sec 
3.	Incubate for 3 min at room temp. 
4.	Add 20 µL of Protein Precipitation Solution BF
5.	Vortex for 5 sec
6.	Incubate for 1 min at room temp. 
7.	Centrifuge for 3 min at 11,000 x g
8.	Transfer the clear supernatant into a new 2 mL collection tube
9.	Add 270 µL Isopropanol 
10.	Vortex for 5 sec
11.	Place a microRNA Mini Spin Column BF in a collection tube and load 300 µL sample onto the column
12.	Incubate for 2 min at room temp 
13.	Centrifuge for 30 sec at 11,000 x g
14.	Discard flow-through and place column back into collection tube. 
    -	Maximum column loading volume is 800 µL. Repeat steps 13 and 14 until all the sample has been passed through the column. 
15.	Add 100 µL Wash Solution 1 BF to the microRNA spin column BF
16.	Centrifuge for 30 sec at 11,000 x g
17.	Discard flow-through and place column back into the collection tube 
18.	Add 700 µL Wash Solution 2 BF to microRNA spin column BF. 
19.	Centrifuge for 30 sec at 11,000 x g
20.	Discard flow-through and place column back into the collection tube 
21.	Add 250 µL Wash Solution 2 BF to microRNA spin column BF. 
22.	Centrifuge for 2 min at 11,000 x g to dry membrane completely 
23.	Place the microRNA spin column BF in a new 1.5 mL collection tube 
24.	Add 20 µL RNase free H₂O directly onto the membrane of the microRNA spin column BF 
25.	Incubate for 1 min at room temp 
26.	Close the lid and centrifuge for 1 min at 11,000 x g
27.	Store eluted RNA in -70°C
