Protocol: Exosome Isolation - Ultracentrifugation
=================================================

Created by SP on 2012-08-14
Modified by ALG on 2012-10-05

# Notes:

-   --This protocol was modified from: Current Protocols in Cell Biology
    (2006) 3.22.1-3.22.29 

-   --This protocol is suitable for serum, BALF, and most other
    biological fluids. 

-   --If used in medium, FCS must be exosome free. FCS can be replaced
    with insulin-transferrin-sodium-selenite supplement or BSA (1% w/v)
    if desired (Thery et al. 2002) 

-   --Threads of ultracentrifuge buckets must be coated with Beckman
    Spinkote, and the gaskets must be coated with Beckman Vacuum grease.
     

-   --Must refrigerate SW 41 Ti rotor buckets at 4 degrees C prior to
    running. 

-   --Spins are programmed into the L-70k centrifuge for ease of use.
    Please see page 3-2 of the manual for Programmed Usage.

2.  2.Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) 1x, prepared on N/A by N/A,
    location: stored at room temperature in 1-L glass reagent bottle 

3.  3.Beckman SW 41 Ti rotor, serial\# 97U 10110 (swing-bucket rotor)

6.  6.Beckman Vacuum Grease Silicone, Cat\# 335148 

7.  7.Beckman Polyallomer Centrifuge Tubes, 14 x 89 mm, Lot\# Z11208SCA,
    Reorder\# 331372 

8.  8.Jouan CR 412 Centrifuge 

9.  9.Beckman Optima L-70k Ultracentrifuge 

10. 10.Ice 

 

# Methods:

1.  1.Spin down sample in 50-mL conical tube at 2000xg (3100 RPM in
    Jouan centrifuge) for 30 minutes at 4 degrees C. 

    1.  a.Supernatant after this step contains the exosomes. 

2.  2.Using a serological pipet, remove the supernatant to approximately
    2 cm above pellet. Use a pipetman to remove as much remaining
    supernatant as possible without disturbing the pellet. Transfer
    supernatant to ultracentrifuge tubes. 

    1.  a.Optional: Keep aliquot of supernatant for purification
        analysis if necessary. 

3.  3.Balance tubes with cold PBS using a scale. 

    1.  a.Fill tubes leaving only a few millimeters of empty space. 

    2.  b.Tubes must be weighed within 0.1 – 0.2 g 

4.  4.Spin samples in ultracentrifuge, 12,000xg (8200 RPM with SW 41 Ti)
    for 45 minutes at 4 degrees C. 

    1.  a.This is saved as Program 1 on the Optima L-70k
        Ultracentrifuge 

    2.  b.Supernatant after this step contains the exosomes. 

5.  5.Use serological pipet to remove supernatant from each tube, again
    being careful not to disturb the pellet. Transfer supernatant into
    new ultracentrifuge tubes and replace back in swing buckets. Be sure
    to lightly re-grease threads of buckets. 

    1.  a.Optional: Keep an aliquot of supernatant for purification
        analysis if desired. 

6.  6.Balance tubes with cold PBS as in step 3. 

7.  7.Spin in ultracentrifuge 100,000xg (24,000 RPM with SW 41 Ti) for 2
    hours at 4 degrees C. 

    1.  a.This is saved as Program 2 on the Optima L-70k
        Ultracentrifuge 

    2.  b.Pellet after this step contains exosomes 

8.  8.Use a serological pipet to remove the supernatant from the
    samples. Use a pipetman to remove as much supernatant from the
    pellet as possible without disturbing it. 

    1.  a.Optional: Keep an aliquot of supernatant for purification
        analysis if desired. 

9.  9.Using cold PBS, condense all pellets from same sample into a clean
    ultracentrifuge tube and fill up the tube to near maximum volume. 

    1.  a.Optional: You can add a 0.2 µm filtration step here, but be
        sure to use a filter that will not bind exosomes. See
        supplementary protocols to assess what filters to use. 

10. 10.Balance sample tube with another tube filled with PBS. 

    1.  a.All swing buckets with screwcaps must be attached to the rotor
        whether or not they contain sample. 

11. 11.Spin in ultracentrifuge, 110,000xg (25,000 RPM with SW 41 Ti) for
    1 hour at 4 degrees C. 

    1.  a.This is Program 3 on the Optima L-70k Ultracentrifuge 

    2.  b.Pellet after this step contains the exosomes. 

12. 12.Again, use a serological pipet to remove the supernatant from the
    samples. Use a pipetman to remove as much supernatant from the
    pellet as possible. Resuspend pellet in 60-120 µL of PBS and store
    at -80 degrees C. 

    1.  a.Optional: If you want to conduct exosomal protein analysis,
        you can resuspend in lysis buffer (see BCA protocol).
