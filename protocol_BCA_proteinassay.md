# Methods:
## BCA Protein Assay
1.	Prepare BSA standards using PBS as a diluent
   - Standard curve range for 1:1 ratio assay is approximately between 10 µg/mL and 200 µg/mL.
   - Standard curve range for 1:20 ratio assay is approximately between 200 µg/mL and 8000 µg/mL
   - A “0” standard/reference must be made using PBS in place of sample
   - Selection of standard curve range depends on the source of the sample
2.	Prepare working reagent
   - 50 parts reagent A + 1 part reagent B
   - Amount of working reagent per tube is 10 µL/tube for 1:1 ratio assay, and 80 µL/tube for 1:20 ratio assay
3.	Aliquot proper volume of standards and samples into PCR tubes
   - Volume of standard/sample per tube is 10 µL/tube for 1:1 ratio assay and 4 µL/tube for 1:20 assay
4.	Add proper volume of working reagent to each tube
   - Volume of working reagent per tube is 10 µL/tube for 1:1 ratio assay and 80 µL/tube for 1:20 assay
5.	Incubate tubes in PCR thermocycler at 60 degrees C for 30 minutes.
   - Program is named “BCA”.
   - If evaporation is a problem, incubate tubes at 37 degrees C  for 30 minutes. See additional kit information from Thermo Scientific for full details.
6.	Quantify protein concentration using Nanodrop 1000 BCA program
   - Use 2 µL of sample/standard on Nanodrop sensor
   - Use water as the blank
   - Reference measurement is the “0” standard
   - Remember to save standard curve and data in Gregson folder.
