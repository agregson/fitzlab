# Introduction to the Protocols Branch

This branch contains the protocols that are more or less up-to-date and used in the laboratory.

To clone just this branch, do:

<<<<<<< HEAD
    git clone git://github.com/agregson/fitzlab.git --branch protocols --single-branch protocolsLocal
=======
These can be checked out individually, so we may just keep most of the separate projects as branches to make cloning cleaner. Maybe that is not necessary. For now we have the following branches:

    1. lsrii
	This contains references for running flow and optimizing the LSR II cytometer at the core. 
    2. facscan
	This contains mostly historical references for panels and running the the modified, five-color, FACScan cytometer.
    3. protocols
	This branch contains our most active and up-to-date protocols.
    4. gh-pages
        This is for any wiki pages, but there are only placeholders for now.
