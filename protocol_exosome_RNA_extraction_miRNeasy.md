# Notes:
-	Protocol was taken from: miRNeasy Serum/Plasma Handbook 

# Materials: 
1.	Chloroform (approximately 1 mL)
2.	Ethanol (80%, 100%). Be sure to prepare 80% EtOH with DEPC treated water
3.	2 mL reaction tubes 
4.	MiRNeasy Kit
   - RNeasy MinElute Spin Columns, each with 2mL collection tube   
   - Collection tubes (1.5mL)
   - Collection tubes (2mL)
   - QIAzol Lysis Reagent
   - Buffer RWT
   - Buffer RPE
   - RNase-Free Water

# Methods: 
1.	Prepare serum of plasma or thaw frozen samples
2.	Add 5 volumes of QIAzol Lysis Reagent.
   - Mix by vortexing or pipetting up and down
2.	Place tube containing homogenate on the benchtop at room temperature for 5 minutes.
3.	Add chloroform of an equal volume to the starting sample to the tube containing the homogenate and cap it securely.
   - Shake tube vigorously for 15s.
4. Place tube containing the homogenate of the benchtop for 3 minutes. 
5. Centrifuge for 15 minutes at 12,000x g (14000 rpm Eppendorf minispin centrifuge) at 4C
6. Transfer upper aqueous phase to a new collection tube (not supplied). 
7. Add 1.5 volumes of 100% ethanol to make a total of 825 µL in a reaction tube. Mix by pipetting
9. Pipette up to 700 ul of the sample from reaction tube and transfer into an RNeasy MinElute spin column placed in a 2mL collection tube (supplied). 
10. Close lid gently and centrifuge at 8000 x g for 15s at room temperature. Discard the flow through.
11. Repeat Steps 11-12 using the remainder of the sample. Discard the flow through
12. Add 700 ul buffer RWT to the RNeasy MinElute spin column. Close lid gently and centrifuge for 15s at 8000g (11000 rpm Eppendorf minispin centrifuge). Discard the flow through.
13. Pipette 500 ul Buffer RPE onto the RNeasy MinElute spin column. Close the lid gently, and centrifuge for 15s at 8000g (11000 rpm Eppendorf minispin centrifuge). Discard the flow through.
14. Pipette 500 µL 80% ethanol onto the RNeasy MinElute spin column. Close the lid gently and centrifuge for 2 min at 8000g (11000 rpm Eppendorf minispin centrifuge). Discard the collection tube with the flow through
15. Place RNeasy MinElute spin column into a new 2 mL collection tube (supplied). Open the lid and centrifuge for 5 min at 8000 x g. Discard the flow through
   - Orient the lids so that they point to a direction opposite to the rotation of the rotor
16. Place the RNeasy MinElute spin column into a 1.5 collection tube and pipet 14 µL RNase-free water onto the center of spin column membrane. Close lid gently and centrifuge for 1 min at 12000 x g to elute the RNA. (14500rpm Eppendorf minispin) 
17. Store the eluate in RNase free water in -80°C.
