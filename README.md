# Introduction to the FACScan Branch

This is really just for historical reasons. These are notes and older panel that were used on Dr. Otto Yang's modified, five-color FACScan. I'm not sure if he still has it, but if so these files could be useful to someone. Also, like to keep these as historical documents anyway.
