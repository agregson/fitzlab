======================================================================

# Notes
- Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a *Biosaftey Level 2 Pathogen*. Be sure to open cultures in a biosafety hood *ONLY*.
- Be sure to work in a sterile environment at all times. 
- The machinery used in this procedure needs to be warmed up and calibrated ahead of time.
- Review and be familiar with the IBC safety manual and protocol

# Methods

## Making Trypticase Soy Agar (TSA) plates

1. Dissovle 20g TSA concentrate in 500 mL ddH<sub>2</sub>O in a 1 L Erlenmeyer flask
2. Place magnetic stir rod at the bottom and place on swirling plate
3. Mix by magnetic swirling, microwave 3 minutes, mix by swirling, repeat 3-4 times until powder completely dissolved.
4. Autoclave at 121 degree C for 15 minutes (IMED autoclave settings: easy cycle, liquid, 15 minutes). *Note* that the entire autoclave cycle takes about 2 hours. The magnetic rod stays in the vessel during autoclaving. 
5. At this time, turn waterbath on to 55 degree C.
6. Remove from autoclave (you will have about 20-30 minutes to work with it if not in water bath)
7. Place back on the swirling base to mix the solution to avoid clump/chunks.  
7. _Alternatively_, Place in 55 degree C waterbath,  (make sure to swirl solution around to avoid solidifying).  
8. Lay out dishes in hood (save bags). Keep one plate open in the hood during the entire process as a control. 
9. Pipette 20-25 mL of agar per plate
8. Stack in groups of ten plates and et dry with agar side down for a minimum of 4 hours (overnight is OK)
9. After 4 hours or overnight, flip plates so that the lid is down, store in original bags in groups of ten plates at 4 degrees C.
10. Plates should last at least four months at 4 degree C. 
11. Prior to using plates, place in hood with lid partially uncovered for about 15 minutes to dry the plates and remove the condensation. 

## Making MHB
1. Dissolve 23 g of MHB powder into 1 L ddH<sub>2</sub>O in a 3 L Erlenmeyer flask and mix by swirling plate, until powder completely dissolved
2. Add 10mg MgCl<sub>2</sub> 
3. Add 20mg CaCl<sub>2</sub>
4. Ensure mixed and disolved. 
5. Pour into 1 L bottle with cap as the storage vessel and autoclave in this. 
3. Autoclave at 121C for 15 minutes.  (IMED autoclave settings: easy cycle, liquid, 15 minutes). *Note* that entire autoclave process takes about two hours
4. When autoclaving, be careful to not completely seal the caps. 
4. Store at room temperature. 

# Culturing Pseudomonas aeruginosa 

1. Turn on the shaking incubator and ensure it is set for 37C.
1. Pour 600 ml of prepared MHB buffer into a 1 L flask.
2. Thaw three tubes of Ps. aeruginosa working stock and load them into the 1L flask of MHB using a micropipette. Mix well by swirling.
3. Using a sterile transfer pipette, transfer some of the bacteria culture into a cuvette and a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
4. Cover the cuvette with parafilm and seal the microcentrifuge tube. Put the microcentrifuge tube on ice and leave it there for at least 5 minutes.
5. Put the culture in the shaking incubator set at 37C. 
6. Steps 3 through 5 are to be repeated every 2 hours for 12 hours.

# Measuring Optical Density (to be done every 2 hours for 12 hours)

1. Turn on the spectrophotometer and let it warm up for 5 minutes
2. After choosing the single wavelength setting, set the desired wavelength at 600nm.
3. Zero the spectrophotometer using a cuvette filled with MHB without bacteria
4. After the spectrophotometer has been zeroed, take the appropriate cuvette prepared in "Culturing Pseudomonas aeruginosa" (above), wipe the sides with Kim Wipes, and insert it into the spectrophotometer
5. Record the OD measured.

# CFU Calculations (to be done every 2 hours for 12 hours)

1. Dry an agar plate by slightly leaving the lid open in an inverted position
2. To prepare serial dilutions, fill wells A2-A11 of a 96 well plate with 90uL of MHB buffer. 
3. Take the cell culture microcentrifuge tube off the ice and transfer 100uL of the cooled culture into well A1. 
4. Perform serial dilutions by transferring 10uL of culture of A1 to well A2 and mixing. Then, take 10uL of the mixture of well A2 and transfer it to well A3 and mix well by pipetting. Do the same for wells A3-A11. The end result should be the dilution of culture into concentrations of 10<sup>-1</sup>, 10<sup>-2</sup>, 10<sup>-3</sup>, 10<sup>-4</sup>, 10<sup>-5</sup>, 10<sup>-6</sup>, 10<sup>-7</sup>, 10<sup>-8</sup>, 10<sup>-9</sup>, 10<sup>-10</sup> for wells A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A9, A10, respectively. 
5. When the agar plate is dried, transfer 10uL of each of the dilutions from 10<sup>-3</sup> to 10<sup>-10</sup> to appropriate locations on the agar plate.  There should be 8 spots on the agar plate after a single transfer of each of the selected dilutions.
6. Let the agar plate dry completely by leaving the lid open. (takes about 1 hour)
7. These steps are to be done every 2 hours for 12 hours. Use row B for hour 2, row C for hour 4, so on and so forth.
8. Wait to incubate the plates until the plates from hour 12 is prepared and dried. All the plates need to go in the 37C incubator at the same time. Read the plates after 12 hours of incubation.
