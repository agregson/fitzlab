# Protocol Notes:
-   Protocol was modified from: Thermo Scientific Precise Protein Gels Handbook

# Materials: 

1. 100% Reagent Grade Methanol
2. Coomassie Dye Powder
3. 100% Glacial Acetic Acid 
4. Gel Cassette and Gel Tank
5. DC Power Supply
6. Fisher Scientific Dry Bath Incubator
7. Eppendorf Minispin Plus Centrifuge (Fits 12 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes)
8. 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes
9. Tube rack
10. Water trays
11. Magnetic stirrer, stirrer bar
12. Colored microcentrifuge tube cap
13. Boekel Rocker II scientific rocker
14. Thermo Scientific Precise Protein Gels Kit
    - Tris-HEPES-SDS Precast Polyacrylamide Mini Gels (size?), Cat#
    - Marker (Maintained in -20 degrees C in Refrigerator 1)
    - 2x Sample Buffer
    - BupH Tris-HEPES-SDS Running Buffer Packets

# Methods: 

1. Make running buffer by mixing the contents of one BupH Tris-HEPES-SDS Running Buffer Powder with 500 ml of double distilled water.
    - Mix using a magnetic stirrer until solutes are completely dissolved (takes about 5 minutes) 
2. Preparation of Coomassie Blue Stain.
    - Add 100 ml of acetic acid to 450 ml of ultrapure water
    - Dissolve 3 g of Coomassie Dye in 450 ml of methanol
    - Mix the two well
3. Prepare the Coomassie Blue Destain by mixing water, methanol, and acetic acid at a ratio of 60%, 30%, and 10%.
4. Prepare sample by adding sample buffer in a ratio of 1:3, sample buffer to sample, in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube
5. Heat the sample in a heater at 100 degrees C for 5 minutes
    - Make sure to secure the lid on the tube with a colored cap
    - After heating, briefly open the lid of the microcentrifuge away from the face to let out pressure
6. Centrifuge the sample in the Minispin centrifuge at 6000 rpm for 3 minutes
7. Prepare and set up the gel cassette and tank.
    - When inserting the gel into the casket, make sure the gel openings are facing the inside of the gel casket
    - Insert the assembled gel casket into the gel tank
8. Pour the running buffer prepared earlier into the casket, so that the buffer fills up the casket and overflows into the gel tank.
9. Clean out the wells to be used in gel electrophoresis by flushing out the wells using a pipette.
10. Load the ladder and the supernatant of the centrifuged samples using a pipette into their respective wells.
    - The manual recommends 5 mcl of ladder per well for a mini-gel and 10 mcl of ladder per well for a large gel.
    - Each sample well holds 25 - 50 mcl, but 30 mcl of sample works best.
11. Close the lid and connect the wires to the power supply, making sure that the colors match.
    - The wires and the lid are color coated so that one can connect the positive and negative charges to their proper ends.
12. Run the gel at 100 V for 40 minutes or until whenever the samples nearly reach the end of the gel.
13. While the gel is running, prepare three trays, each filled with 200 ml of water.
14. After the gel is completely run, dump out the buffer. Then, remove the gel from the casket using a gel knife.
15. Perform a gel wash using the three trays prepared earlier. Wash the gel in a single tray for approximately 5 minutes before transferring to the next.
    - Exercise caution not to rip the gel
16. Fill another tray with Coomassie Blue Stain, place the washed gel in Coomassie Blue and stain it for 1 - 3 hours on a Boekel Rocker II scientific rocker at low intensity
17. After the gel is stained, fill a different tray with Coomassie Blue destain. Place the stained gel in the Coomassie Blue destain and destain it for 1 - 3 hours on a Boekel Rocker II scientific rocker at low intensity.
18. At this point, the gel can be examined for bands or washed again in water for 1 hour. Gel left in water for more than 1 day after step 17 loses sensitivity.
