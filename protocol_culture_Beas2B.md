## Protocol Notes

### Biohazard Safety

-    Be sure to work in a biohazard safety cabinet at all times. Wipe the cabinet before and after use with 70% ethanol or BacDown disinfectant. 
-    Use universal biosafety precautions, wear a barrier resistant lab coat, disposable gloves, and other appropriate PPE.
-    When disposing BAL fluids, add 10% bleach solution to the discarded fluid to disinfect the cells and fluid for at least 10 minutes ("10 for 10"), then discard and rinse down the drain. 
-    While spinning in centrifuge, cover the samples with the "Biohazard" caps to prevent the spread of infectious content in the case of a spill. 
-    Dispose of trash in the designated "Biohazard" trash cans. Be sure to double bag the pipets before disposal. 

# Materials
1. Bovine type 1 collagen 
   - Collagen from calf skin, Sigma, Cat # 8919
   - Bornstein and Traub Type I, (0.1% solution in 0.1 M acetic acid)
   - concentration is 1 mg/mL (i.e., 0.1% solution)
2. Purified Human Fibronectin
   - MP Biomedicals, Cat # 855913 
   - concentration is 5.3 mg/mL
   - each vial contains 1 mg of fibronectin
3. BSA
   - Stock solution is produced so that 1 mcL is used per 10 mL of coating solution
4. PVP
   - Located on the dry chemical shelf. 
   - Stock solution at 5% is kept on the lab bench

## Plate Coating Solution
Requires that a special coating solution be applied to plates and flasks that will be used to grow Beas2B. 
Stock is kept in fridge #6.

   - Final Concentrations:
      - Fibronectin 0.01 mg/mL
      - Bovine Type one collagen 0.03 mg/mL
      - Bovine serum albumin (BSA) 0.01 mg/mL (dissolved in BEBM)
   - For each 10 mL of final coating solution, use the following:
      - Fibronectin: 19 mcL
      - Collagen: 300 mcL
      - BSA: 1 mcL
   
## Trypsin Release Media
Requires the addition of 0.1% PVP. Will keep a stock of this separately from regular trypsin in Fridge #6.
