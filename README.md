Gregson laboratory respository

# Introduction

I will start adding some files here as a repository for the laboratory. I think in the long run it may be easier to have all of it here on github than on a separate blog only. This way we can create branches that represent different projects. I would think people could then just clone out the parts that they need. We'll see how this goes.
