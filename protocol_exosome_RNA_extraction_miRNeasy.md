# Notes:
-	Protocol was taken from: miRNeasy Micro Handbook 
# Materials: 
1.	Chloroform (approximately 1 mL)
2.	Ethanol (70%, 80%, 100%). Be sure to prepare 80% EtOH with DEPC treated water
3.	2 mL reaction tubes 
4.	MiRNeasy Kit
    -	 RNeasy MinElute Spin Columns, each with 2mL collection tube   
    -	Collection tubes (1.5mL)
    -	Collection tubes (2mL)
    -	QIAzol Lysis Reagent
    -	Buffer RWT
    -	Buffer RPE
    -	RNase-Free Water
# Methods: 
1.	Distrupt the cells by adding 700 µL QIAzol Lysis Reagent. 
2.	Homogenize the cells by vortexing for 1 min. 
3.	Place tube containing homogenate on the benchtop at room temperature for 5 minutes 
4.	Add 140 µL of chloroform to tube containing the homogenate and cap it securely. Shake tube vigorously for 15s. 
5.	Place tube containing the homogenate of the benchtop for 3 minutes. 
6.	Centrifuge for 15 minutes at 12,000x g
7.	Transfer upper aqueous to a 2mL reaction tube. This will be approximately 350 µL
8.	Add 350 µL 70% ethanol to make a total of 700 µL in a reaction tube. 
9.	Pipette the sample from reaction tube and transfer into an RNeasy MinElute spin column placed in a 2mL collection tube. 
10.	Close lid gently and centrifuge at 8000 x g for 15s at room temperature. Pipet flow-through (which contains miRNA) into a 2 mL reaction tube. 
    a.	 Save RNeasy MinElute spin column in a 2 mL reaction tube over ice. Use in step 18.  
11.	Add 450 µL of 100% ethanol to the flow-through from step 10 and vortex. 
12.	Pipette 700 µL of sample into RNeasy MinElute spin column placed in a 2 mL collection tube. Close lid and centrifuge for 15s at 8000 x g. Discard flow-through 
    a.	Repeat this step until the whole sample had been pipette into the spin column. Discard flow-through each time. 
13.	Pipette 500 µL Buffer RPE ino the RNeasy MinElute spin column. Close lid gently and centrifuge for 15s at 8000 x g. Discard flow-through.    
14.	Add 500 µL of 80% ethanol to the RNeasy MinElute spin column. Close lid gently and centrifuge for 2 min at 8000 x g. Discard flow-through and collection tube. 
    a.	Remove column carefully. The column should not touch flow-through.
15.	Place RNeasy MinElute spin column into a new 2 mL collection tube. Open the lid and centrifuge for 5 min at 8000 x g 
16.	Place the RNeasy MinElute spin column into a 1.5 collection tube and pipet 14 µL RNase-free water onto the center of spin column membrane. Close lid gently and centrifuge for 1 min at 8000 x g to elute miRNA-enriched fraction. 
17.	Store the eluate in RNase free water in -80°C.
18.	Pipet 700 µL Buffer RWT into RNeasy MinElute spin column from step 10. Close lid gently and centrifuge for 1 min at 8000 x g.
19.	Add 500 µL Buffer RPE to the RNeasy MinElute spin column. Close lid gently and centrifuge for 15s at 8000 x g. Discard flow-through.  Repeat this step using another 500 µL Buffer RPE. 
20.	  Place RNeasy MinElute spin column into a new 2 mL collection tube. Open the lid and centrifuge for 5 min at 8000 x g 
21.	 Place the RNeasy MinElute spin column into a 1.5 collection tube and pipet 14 µL RNase-free water onto the center of spin column membrane. Close lid gently and centrifuge for 1 min at 8000 x g to elute RNA. 
22.	Store the eluate in RNase free water in -80°C.
