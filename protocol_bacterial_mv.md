Protocol: Isolation of Bacterial Membrane Vesicles
==================================================

# Protocol Notes:[^1]
-   Grow pseudomonas from frozen stock to provide supernatant for membrane vesicles
-   Purpose is to isolate the bacterial membrane vesicles using ultracentrifugation
-   This protocol is suitable for serum, BALF, and most other biological fluids.
-   Threads of ultracentrifuge buckets must be coated with Beckman Spinkote, and the gaskets must be coated with Beckman Vacuum grease. 
-   Must refrigerate SW 41 Ti rotor buckets at 4 degrees C prior to running.

    1. Dissovle 20 g into 500 mL ddH2O.  Mix by swirling, microwave 3 minutes, mix by swirling, repeat 3-4 times until powder completely dissolved.  Autoclave at 121 degrees C for 15 minutes.  (IMED autoclave settings: easy cycle, liquid, 15 minutes) At this time, turn waterbath on to 55 degree C.
    2. Remove from autoclave, mix solution by swirling to avoid clump/chunks.  Place in 55 degree C waterbath, lay out dishes in hood (save bags), pipette 20-25 mL per plate (make sure to swirl solution around to avoid solidifying).  Let dry 10-20 minutes, cover, flip, store in original bags at 4 degrees C.


# Methods: 

1. Plate frozen stock cultures of *Ps. aeruginosa* on trypticase soy agar (TSA) plates. Grow *Ps. aeruginosa* at 37 degrees C for approximately 24 hours.

2. Prepare and autoclave 1 liter of cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton Broth medium (containing 1.23 mM calcium chloride dihydrate and 1.03 mM magnesium chloride hexahydrate).

3. Add 1500 mL of Mueller-Hinton Broth to sterile 3L glass Erlenmeyer flasks

4. Using a sterile 10 mcl inoculation loop, scrape a 2 colonies of *Ps. aeruginosa* growth from agar plates (from Day 1) and transfer into 250-mL flask with MHB in it (Step 3). Grow broth cultures at 37 degree C for approximately 6 h with gentle shaking (New Brunswick Scientific Incubator Shaker G25)

5. Obtain *Ps. aeruginosa* cultures from the shaking incubator and remove a 1-ml aliquot from each 250/500-ml culture to check the respective optical densities. Late exponential phase *Ps. aeruginosa* is used (~ 10^9^ cfu ml^-1^), usually at approximately six to eight hours of incubation.
    - Based on this cfu, the OD would be 0.900

6. Add stock concentration gentamicin to 3L bacterial culture flasks to final concentration of 8 mcL/mL. Incubate gentamicin in the culture flask x30 minutes on orbital shaker at 37 degrees C.
    - 32 mcL for 200 mL culture volume
    - 16 mcL for 100 mL culture volume

6. Using a serological pipet, remove entire volume of supernatant required at one time, transferring to sterile 50-mL polystyrene conical tubes. Balance tubes with cold 50 mM HEPES using a scale.
    1.  Fill tubes leaving only a few millimeters of empty space.
    2.  Tubes must be weighed within 0.1 – 0.2 g of one another

9. Spin samples in Sorval Legend XTR, 6,000 g (6000 RPM with F13-14-50cy) for 30 minutes at 4 degrees C.
    1.  This is saved as Program ? on the Sorval Legend XTR centrifuge
    2.  *Supernatant* after this step contains the membrane vesicles.
    3.  Discard the pellet.

10. Filter supernatant sequentially through 0.45 and then 0.22 micron cellulose acetate filters to remove any bacteria.

11. Using a serological pipet, transfer filtered supernatant to ultracentrifuge tubes. Balance tubes with cold 50 mM HEPES using a scale.
    1.  Fill tubes leaving only a few millimeters of empty space.
    2.  Tubes must be weighed within 0.1 – 0.2 g of one another

12. Spin samples in ultracentrifuge, 150,000 g (44,000 RPM with 45 Ti) for 3 hours at 4 degrees C.
    1.  This is saved as Program ? on the Optima L-70k Ultracentrifuge
    2.  *Pellet* after this step contains the membrane vesicles. Mark location of pellet with pen to facilitate extraction.
    3.  Discard the supernatant.
    4.  Place volume in excess of 72 mL into 4 degrees C at once
    5.  Note that only 72 mL can be processed at one time in the SW 41 Ti rotor
    6.  Multiple passes may need to be done to process all of the supernatant

13. Use a serological pipet to carefully aspirate the supernatant from the
    samples. Use a pipetman to remove as much supernatant from the
    pellet as possible.

14. Resuspend membrane vesicle pellet in 50 mM HEPES buffer and using serological pipet transfer the suspension to 50-mL conical tubes. Balance tubes with cold 50 mM HEPES using a scale.
    1.  We do a one spin wash of the vesicle pellet
    2.  Fill tubes leaving only a few millimeters of empty space.
    3.  Tubes must be weighed within 0.1 – 0.2 g of one another

16. Spin samples in ultracentrifuge, 120,000 g (39,000 RPM with 45 Ti) for 30 minutes at 4 degrees C. (Alternatively, use the SW41 Ti at 31,174 RPM for 52 minutes at 4 degrees C.) 
    1.  This is saved as Program ? on the Optima L-70k Ultracentrifuge
    2.  *Pellet* after this step contains the membrane vesicles.
    3.  Discard the supernatant.


21. Using serological pipet, resuspend pellet in 200-400 mcL of 50 mM HEPES 

21. Determine membrane vesicle protein content using a (Micro) BCA protein assay reagent kit using the NanoDrop.

22. Plate approximately 1/10 of each final pellet (~50 mcg from each pellet) on TSA plate and incubate at 37 degrees C x48h to ensure no bacterial colonies form.
    - If no colonies form, then membrane vesicle pellet can be considered sterile

23. Freeze membrane vesicles at -80 degree C in freezer #2, shelf #4.
