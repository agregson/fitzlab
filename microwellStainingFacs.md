Microwell Staining for Multiparameter Flow Cytometry
====================================================

# PROTOCOL# PROTOCOL [^1]	

All steps are performed in a clean, biological safety cabinet. 
Once the Vital Stain is introduced into the samples, the lights within the biological safety cabinet are turned off whenever the samples are present. 
All centrifugation is done with the temperature set at 4 C. 

# Supplies

1. 200 mcL round-bottom, 96-well plate, hard bottom for vortex
2. DPBS + 4% fetal calf serum (FCS) + 0.1% Na Azide [Wash Buffer](Wash Buffer)
3. Paraformaldehyde (PFA) 1% (PFA is poisonous)
4. R10 (RP + 10% FCS), warm
5. Fluorescent labelled antibodies and Live/Dead Blue
6. FoxP3 Fixation Buffer 
7. FoxP3 Permeabilization Buffer
8. Lysing Buffer
9. 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes to mix antibodies
10. flow tubes with lids
11. Cotton gauze either 2x2 or 4x4 inch size (to process fresh BALF)
12. 50 mL conical tubes (to process fresh BALF)
13. 15 mL conical tubes (to thaw cryopreserved cells)


#### Process Fresh BALF

If only previously cryopreserved cells are to be used, then omit this step and proceed to the next step.

1. Filter BALF through 2x2 or 4x4 gauze to remove mucous and other large non-cellular debris such as clots.
    1. Place the gauze on top of a 50 mL conical tube, making a small dimple in the center. 
    2. Pre-soak the gauze with PBS to minimize loss of the sample. 
	3. Carefully pour the entire sample through the gauze filter.
	4. Rinse the gauze with PBS to a maximum volume fo 45 mL per 50 mL conical tube. This may aid in recovering cells trapped in the gauze.
2. Pellet cells with centrifugation at 1200 rpm for 8 minutes. There is usually about 40 mL of PBS in each 50 mL conical tube.
4. Remove supernatant the supernatant by your prefered method, being careful not to disturb the cell pellet.
    1. If more than one collection tube was obtained for the same sample, the cell pellets can be combined into one tube at this time.
5. Resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of PBS for Vital stain as below.

#### Thaw Cryopreserved Cells

If cryopreserved cells are not to be used then this step is omitted.

1. Prepare sufficient warm R10 and sufficient number of 15 mL conical tubes. You will need one tube per cryopreserved sample. 
2. Add 2 mL warm R10 to each 15 mL conical tube.
3. Carefully thaw cryopreserved cells in a warm water bath until the solution is the consistency of slush. 
4. Wash the outside of each cryotube quickly with 70% ethanol. 
4. Place thawed cells (slush) into the 15 mL tube.
5. Sit at room temperature for 5 minutes.
6. Slowly add 8 mL warm R10 to each 15 mL tube. Ensure that the cells mix thoroughly as you add the R10 dropwise to avoid clumping the cells. 
7. Centrifuge at 1200 rpm x 2 minutes to pellet the cells.

#### Vital Stain 

This is performed for all samples, fresh or frozen.

1. Resuspend cell pellet in 1 mL PBS. You must use PBS because amino acids will decrease dye effectiveness.

3. Vortex gently.
4. *Incubate at 37 C x 20 minutes* Longer incubation is of no benefit.
5. Add 9 mL warm R10 to quinch the reaction.
6. Centrifuge at 1200 rpm x 2 minutes to pellet cells.
7. Resuspend each cell pellet in 180 mL R10 for transfer to 96-well plate for staining.

#### Surface Staining 

This step can be completed in about 60 minutes depending upon the number of samples.
