Exosome Isolation - Ultracentrifugation
=======================================

# Protocol Notes [^1]

-   The longer spin times should always be used unless there is an extreme exception. 

-   This protocol is suitable for serum, BALF, and most other biological fluids. 

-   If used in medium, FCS must be exosome free. FCS can be replaced with insulin-transferrin-sodium-selenite supplement or BSA (1% w/v) if desired (Thery2002). It preferred that the exosomes be ultracentrifuged out of the media. 

-   Threads of ultracentrifuge buckets must be coated with Beckman Spinkote, and the gaskets must be coated with Beckman Vacuum grease. An extremely thin layer should be applied. You should not see grease when done with applicaiton. 

-   Must refrigerate SW 41Ti rotor buckets at 4 degrees C prior to running.

-   Spins are programmed into the L-70k centrifuge for ease of use. Please see page 3-2 of the manual for Programmed Usage.

-   This protocol was originally modified from Thery2006, then modified after Laesser2012 and most recently updated to reflect findings in Cvjetkovic2014 reflecting changes in centrifuge rotors and lab equipment.

### Biohazard Safety

-    Be sure to work in a biohazard safety cabinet at all times. Wipe the cabinet before and after use with 70% ethanol or BacDown disinfectant. 
-    Use universal biosafety precautions, wear a barrier resistant lab coat, disposable gloves, and other appropriate PPE.
-    When disposing BAL fluids, add 10% bleach solution to the discarded fluid to disinfect the cells and fluid for at least 10 minutes ("10 for 10"), then discard and rinse down the drain. 
-    While spinning in centrifuge, cover the samples with the "Biohazard" caps to prevent the spread of infectious content in the case of a spill. 
-    Dispose of trash in the designated "Biohazard" trash cans. Be sure to double bag the pipets before disposal.

# Methods

1.  If sample has not yet been centrifuged to remove cells, then centrifuge sample in 50-mL conical tube at 300*g in the Sorval Legend XTR centrifuge for 10 minutes at 4 degrees C.
    1.  This is saved as Program 2 on the Sorval Legend XTR centrifuge
    2.  *Supernatant* after this step contains the exosomes.

2.  Using a serological pipet, remove the supernatant to approximately 2 cm above pellet. Use a pipetman to remove as much remaining supernatant as possible without disturbing the pellet. Transfer supernatant to ultracentrifuge tubes.
    1.  Optional: Keep aliquot of supernatant for purification analysis if necessary.

3.  Fill ultracentrifuge tubes with 12mL of supernatant, leaving only a few millimeters of empty space.
    1.  Balance tubes with cold PBS using a scale.
    2.  If there are an uneven number of filled tubes, fill a tube with ddH20 to balance the SW 41Ti (swing bucket) rotor.
    3.  SW 41Ti 13.5mL tubes must be weighed to within 0.1 – 0.2 g of each other.
    4.  The 94mL 45Ti tubes can be weighted to within 1g of each other. The weight is usually around 134g.

4.  Spin samples in ultracentrifuge, 16,500*g (14,500 RPM with 45 Ti) for 25 minutes at 4 degrees C. _Alternatively_, use SW 41Ti (11,500 RPM) for 44 minutes at 4 degrees C.
    1.  This is saved as Program 4 on the Optima L-70k Ultracentrifuge
    2.  This step is designed to remove most non-exosome microvesicles.
    3.  *Supernatant* after this step contains the exosomes.

5.  Use serological pipet to remove supernatant from each tube, again being careful not to disturb the pellet.
    1.  Cut one of the tubes in half. Wash the other tubes in 70% ethanol and store in box labeled "Used tubes" for reuse.
    2.  Resuspend the pellet in the pre-cut tube with 40µL of 50mM HEPES.
    3.  Save the pellet in a 1.5mL microcentrifuge tube (label: BL----, cell pellet, date).
    4.  Store in the box at -80C labeled "First Run Pellet" BALF ultracentrifugation.

6.  Filter supernatant using 250 mL EMD Millipore Stericup, 0.22 micron PVDF membrane filters.

7.  Transfer supernatant into new ultracentrifuge tubes (usually the SW 41Ti rotor can be used at this stage). Be sure to lightly re-grease threads of buckets.
    1.  Optional: Keep an aliquot of supernatant for purification analysis if desired.

8.  Balance tubes with cold PBS as in step 3.

9.  Spin in ultracentrifuge 118,000*g (39,000 RPM with 45 Ti) for 5 hours at 4 degrees C. _Alternatively_, use SW 41 Ti (31,000 RPM) for 6.5 hours at 4 degress C. 
    1.  Requires a *delayed* start in the Ultracentrifuge, timed to complete the spin in the morning when processing can be immediately continued. The holding temperature should be set at 4 degrees C.
    2.  The spun pellet cannot sit in the ultracentrifuge for long prior to continuing with processing.
    3.  *Pellet* after this step contains exosomes.

10.	_Alternative:_ If not able to complete processing in the AM which is required by the overnight spin, then spin in ultracentrifuge 118,000*g (39,000 RPM with 45 Ti) for 1.5 hours at 4 degrees C. _Alternatively_, use SW 41 Ti (31,000 RPM) for 2 hours at 4 degress C. 
    1.  This is saved as Program 2 on the Optima L-70k Ultracentrifuge
    2.  This _shorter spin is highly discouraged_. Overnight, longer spin is much preferred due to increased yields
    3.  *Pellet* after this step contains exosomes

11. Again, use a serological pipet to remove the supernatant from the samples into a 50-mL Falcon tube. Use a pipetman to remove as much supernatant from the pellet as possible. 
    1.  Cut all the 13.5mL ultracentrifuge tubes in half
    2.  Resuspend the pellets in each tube in PBS (total volume should be ~200µL)
    3.  Save the pellet in a 1.5mL microcentrifuge tube (label: BL----, exosomes, date)
    4.  Store in the box at -80C labeled "Exosomes" BALF ultracentrifugation
    5.  Optional: If you want to conduct exosomal protein analysis, you can resuspend in lysis buffer (see BCA protocol).

12. Save two 1.8mL aliquots of the supernatant in 2-mL cryovials (label: BL----, supernatant, date)
    1.  Store in the box at -80C labeled "Second Run Supernatant" BALF ultracentrifugation
