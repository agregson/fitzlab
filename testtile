Fresh PBMC or BALF
1. Heparinized PBMC (green tops)
1. 400 mcL of blood per flow tube
2. Place blood volume for total tubes needed in sufficient size conical tube (usually 15 mL)
3. Place 2 mL of Lysing Buffer per 100 mcL of blood into conical tube
4. Vortex and mix thoroughly
5. Incubate at room temperature 4 minutes
6. Spin down at 1200 rpm for 4 minutes
7. Remove supernatant, vortex cells, add 200 mcL of Wash Buffer per flow tube to be stained, vortex
8. Place 200 mcL of resuspended Wash Buffer and cells into each well of 96-well round bottom plate
2. Fresh BALF
1. Filter through 2x2 or 4x4 gauze with PBS
2. Pellet cells with centrifugation 1200 rpm for 8 minutes (usually in ~40 mL PBS in 50 mL conical)
1. If more than one tube for same sample may combine into one tube after this step
3. Remove supernatant
4. Resuspend in 1 mL of PBS for Vital stain as below
3. CPT Blood
1. Spin tubes down according to manufacturer's recommendations
1. *Will be updated to include instructions here in future*
Thawing Cells   (frozen BALF or PBMC)
1. Warm sufficient R10 & gather sufficient number of 15 mL conical tubes
2. Add 2 mL warm R10 to each 15 mL conical tube
3. Put thawed cells (slush) into the  15 mL tube
4. Sit at room temperature x 5 minutes
5. Slowly add 8 mL warm R10
6. Spin down 1200rpm x 2 minutes
Vital Stain (All Samples) **DO NOT DO FOR FRESH BLOOD AND FRESH CPT BLOOD**
1. Resuspend in 1 mL PBS (must be PBS, amino acids will decrease dye effectiveness)
2. Add 1 mcL Live/Dead Blue (is in the 4 oC freezer)
3. Vortex gently
4. Incubate at 37 oC x 20 minutes (longer incubation will not help)
5. Add 9 mL warm R10 (quinches reaction)
6. Spin 1200 x 2 minutes
7. Resuspend each in 180 mL R10 for transfer to 96-well plate for staining
Surface Staining:					(~ 60 minutes)
 1.  Get sample into each well (each well will become a flow tube)
 1.1.  place 180 mcL of sample into each well (R10) (i.e., entire sample)
 1.2.  spin plate 1200rpm x 2 minutes
 1.3.  flip drip dry
 1.4.  wipe off top
 1.5.  agitate via quick vortex
 2.  Stain the cells
 2.1.  Add the Master Mix of surface mAb sufficient quantity to each well
 2.2.  If total staining volume is not >=24 mcL, add sufficient Wash Buffer to make total volume >=24mcL
 2.3.  mix with 10 mcL pipet (up and down 5â€”10 times)
 2.4.  incubate at 4 oC for 30 minutes (in the cold, dark refrigerator)
 3.  Wash antibody off of cells
 3.1.  add 180 mcL of washing solution
 3.2.  spin plate 1200rpm x 2 minutes
 3.3.  flip drip dry
 3.4.  wipe off top
 3.5.  agitate via quick vortex
FoxP3 Staining:						(2+ hours)
 1.  Staining as for normal antibody first, but prior to normal fixation
 2.  Fix cells
 2.1.  add 180 mcL Fixation Buffer
 2.2.  mix well, will likely clump
 2.3.  incubate 60 minutes at 4 oC
 3.  Wash off Fixation Buffer
 3.1.  spin cells at 1200rpm x 2 minutes
 3.2.  flip drip dry
 3.3.  wipe off top
