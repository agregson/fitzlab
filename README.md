# Introduction to the Protocols Branch

This branch contains the protocols that are more or less up-to-date and used in the laboratory. 

## Printing Individual Protocols
Each file is in github markdown formatting. I had previously maintained pdf versions of each file for printing, but I have found an easier way. Visit the protocol page that you wish to print and in the web address change 

    'github.com/...' to 'gitprint.com/...'

A formatted pdf will be downloaded. (see http://gitprint.com/ for further details if desired)

## Cloning
To clone just this branch, do:

    git clone git://github.com/agregson/fitzlab.git --branch protocols --single-branch protocolsLocal
