Protocol Make Flow Compensation Beads
=====================================

# Supplies

1. 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes (one for each fluorochrome)
2. Positive and negative BD CompBeads
3. flow tubes (one for each fluorochrome)
4. Microcentrifuge
5. Wash buffer

# Protocol

1. Place 1 drop of positive and negative Comp Beads in each 1.5 mL centrifuge tube
2. Place 5 mcL of each mAb in separate tubes. 
    - Use same amount of mAb that use in master mix. For example, if you place only 2 mcL of the mAb in the staining master mix, then use only 2 mcL of the mAb for the compensation. 
3. Incubate x 15 minutes at room temperature in the dark.
4. Add 1 mL of washing buffer to each 1.5 mL centrifuge tube.
5. Centrifuge in microcentrifuge for 3-4 minutes.
6. Vacuum out supernatant.
7. Resuspend in 200 mcL of wash buffer in flow tube.
8. Keep at 4 C and in the dark until ready to acquire on the cytometer.
