Cell Thawing 
1. Add 10 ml of sterile water to T-75 flask 
2. Add 15 µl Poly-L-Lysine stock solution to flask
3. Leave in incubator overnight (minimum 1 hour at 37°C)
4. Prepare medium by adding supplement tube to basal medium. Be sure to use a sterile technique.
5. Rinse Poly-L-Lysine coated flask with sterile water twice
6. Add 20 ml of complete medium to the flask, and go to thaw cells
7. Thaw cells and dispense into Poly-L-Lysine treated flask. Seeding Density: 5,000 cells/cm² 
8. After rocking the flask to distribute cells evenly, return flask to incubator and do not disturb for at least 16 hours. 
9. Change the growth medium the next day to remove DMSO and unattached cells, then every other day thereafter. Cells should be polygonal shaped, sheets of contiguous cells, and the cell number will double after 2-3 days in culture. 
Maintenance 
1. Change medium every three days until the culture is approximately 70% confluent
2. Once it reaches 70% confluence, change medium every other day until culture is 90% confluent
Subculture
1. Prepare Poly-L-Lysine coated flasks (2µg/cm²) 
2. Warm medium, trypsin/ETDA, Trypsin neutralizing solution, and DPBS to room temperature. Don’t use 37°C waterbath 
3. Rinse cells with DPBS
4. Add 7 ml of DPBS and 3ml of trypsin/ETDA (in T-75 flask) and gently rock the flask until trypsin/ETDA has covered all cells. Incubate flask at 37°C incubator for 1 – 3 minutes or until cells are lifted from the bottom of the flask. 
5. During incubation, prepare a 50 ml conical tube with 5 ml FBS. Transfer trypsin/ETDA from flask to the conical tube (small percentage of cells will be lifted).
6. Take flask (with no fluid) and incubate at 37°C for 1 – 2 minutes more.
7. After trypsinization, turn the flask and tap gently to detach cells from attachment. Check under microscope to determine if cells are detached. 
8. Add 5 ml of TNS (or medium) to the flask and transfer detached cells to the 50 ml centrifuge tube. Repeat this step. 
9. Centrifuge 50 ml centrifuge tube at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes. Resuspend cells in growth medium 
10. Count and plate cells in new Poly-L-Lysine coated flasks.
