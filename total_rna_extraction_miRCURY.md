Protocol: Total RNA extraction miRCURY
======================================

Created by DC on 6/26/15

# Notes:
Protocol was modified from: RNA-Isolation-biofluids-manual miRCURY 

# Materials: 
1. Isopropanol HPLC (~300ul per sample)
2. Eppendorf Minispin Centrifuge
3. Vortex Genie
4. 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes 
5. miRCURY RNA Isolation Kit-Biofluid contents
   - Lysis Solution BF   
   - Protein Precipitation Solution BF
Reaction buffer for rDNase
rDNase, RNase-free (add Reaction buffer for rDNase as indicated on container and aliquot away in -20C)
Wash Solution 1 BF
Wash Solution 2 BF (Concentrate) (add ethanol as indicated on container)
RNase-Free Water
microRNA Mini Spin Columns BF
Collection Tubes (1.5ml)
Collection Tubes (2ml)
Collection Tubes with lid (2ml)

# Methods: 
1. After thawing, centrifuge sample at 3000g for 5 min to pellet any debris and insoluble compounds (6750 rpm on the Minispin)
2. Transfer 200ul of the supernatant into a new tube. If there is less than 200ul of supernatant, add DEPC water to make the final volume 200ul.
3. Add 60ul Lysis solution BF and Vortex for 5 seconds.
a. Incubate for 3 min at room temperature. 
4. Add 20 ul of Protein Precipitation Solution BF, vortex for 5 seconds
a. Incubate for 1 min at room temperature. The solution usually gets cloudy.
b. Centrifuge at 11000g (12500rpm on the Minispin) at room temperature for 3 mins
5. Transfer the clear supernatant into a new collection tube (2mL, with Lid)
6. Add 270ul Isopropanol per sample. Vortex for 5 seconds
7. Place a microRNA Mini Spin Column BF in a collection tube and load sample onto the column. 
a. Incubate for 2 mins at room temperature
b. Centrifuge for 30 seconds at 11000g (12500 rpm on the MiniSpin)
c. Discard flow-through and place column back into the collection tube
d. If more than 300ul sample was used, repeat this step until all material is loaded
Optional Steps* 8~11
8. Add 700ul Wash Solution 2 BF to the microRNA spin column BF
a. Centrifuge for 30 seconds at 11000 g (12500rpm on the MiniSpin)
b. Discard flow-through and place column back into the collection tube.
9. Add 250 ul Wash Solution 2 BF to the microRNA spin column BF
a. Centrifuge for 2 min at 11000g (12500rpm on the MiniSpin)
10. Add 50ul rDNase directly onto the membrane of the microRNA spin column BF.
a. Close lid and incubate for 15 min at room temperature
11. Add 100 ul Wash Solution 1 BF to the microRNA spin column BF
a. Centrifuge for 30 seconds at 11000 g.
b. Discard flow-through and place column back into the collection tube.
12. Add 700 ul Wash Solution 2 BF to the microRNA spin column BF.
a. Centrifuge for 30 seconds at 11000 g. (12500 rpm on the MiniSpin)
b. Discard flow-through and place column back into the collection tube.
13. Add 250ul Wash Solution 2 BF to the microRNA spin column BF.
a. Centrifuge for 2 min at 11000 g to dry the membrane completely. (12500 rpm on the MiniSpin)
14. Place the microRNA spin column BF in a new collection tube (1.5ml). 
a. Add 50ul RNase free H20 directly onto the membrane of the microRNA spin column BF.
b. Incubate for 1 min at room temperature
c. Close the lid and centrifuge for 1 min at 11000g.
15. Store the purified RNA sample in -80C for long term storage.
