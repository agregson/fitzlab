Protocol: Total RNA Extraction with miRNEasy from Cells
=======================================================

Created by DC on 5/15/15

# Notes:
Protocol was modified from: miRNeasy Micro Handbook 

# Materials: 
1. Chloroform (approximately 1 mL)
2. Ethanol (80%, 100%). Be sure to prepare 80% EtOH with DEPC treated water
3. 2 mL reaction tubes 
4. MiRNeasy Kit
RNeasy MinElute Spin Columns, each with 2mL collection tube   
Collection tubes (1.5mL)
Collection tubes (2mL)
QIAzol Lysis Reagent
Buffer RWT
Buffer RPE
RNase-Free Water
Methods: 
1. Collect cells from cell culture using centrifugation. Make sure to use less than 1*10^6 cells. 
2. Distrupt the cells by adding 700 µL QIAzol Lysis Reagent. 
3. Homogenize the cells by vortexing for 1 min. 
4. Place tube containing homogenate on the benchtop at room temperature for 5 minutes 
5. Add 140 µL of chloroform to tube containing the homogenate and cap it securely. Shake tube vigorously for 15s. 
6. Place tube containing the homogenate of the benchtop for 3 minutes. 
7. Centrifuge for 15 minutes at 12,000x g (14000rpm Eppendorf minispin centrifuge) at 4C
8. Transfer upper aqueous phase to a new collection tube (not supplied). This will be approximately 350 µL
9. Add 1.5 volumes (usually 525ul) of 100% ethanol to make a total of 825 µL in a reaction tube. Mix by pipetting
10. Pipette up to 700ul of the sample from reaction tube and transfer into an RNeasy MinElute spin column placed in a 2mL collection tube(supplied). 
11. Close lid gently and centrifuge at 8000 x g for 15s at room temperature. Discard the flow through
