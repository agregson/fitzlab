# Introduction to the Master Laboratory Repository

I will start adding some files here as a repository for the laboratory. I think in the long run it may be easier to have all of it here on github than on a separate blog only. This way we can create branches that represent different projects. I would think people could then just clone out the parts that they need. We'll see how this goes. It might have been wiser to create different repositories for different projects, but I think for now deadend branches that are never merged may work OK. 

### Branches

These can be checked out individually, so we may just keep most of the separate projects as branches to make cloning cleaner. Maybe that is not necessary. For now we have the following branches:

    1. lsrii
	This contains references for running flow and optimizing the LSR II cytometer at the core. 
    2. facscan
	This contains mostly historical references for panels and running the the modified, five-color, FACScan cytometer.
    3. protocols
	This branch contains our most active and up-to-date protocols.
    4. gh-pages
        This is for any wiki pages, but there are only placeholders for now.
