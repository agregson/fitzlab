Protein Blotting
1. Treat cells by adding fresh media containing regulator for desired time.
2. Aspirate media from cultures; wash cells with 1X PBS; aspirate.
3. Lyse cells by adding 1X SDS sample buffer (100 µl per well of 6-well plate or 500 µl for a 10 cm diameter plate). Immediately scrape the cells off the plate and transfer the extract to a microcentrifuge tube. Keep on ice.
4. Sonicate for 10–15 sec to complete cell lysis and shear DNA (to reduce sample viscosity).
5. Heat a 20 µl sample to 95–100°C for 5 min; cool on ice.
6. Microcentrifuge for 5 min.
7. Load 20 µl onto SDS-PAGE gel (10 cm x 10 cm). 
    a.	NOTE: Loading of prestained molecular weight markers (10 µl/lane) to verify electrotransfer and biotinylated protein ladder (10 µl/lane) to determine molecular weights are recommended.
8. Electrotransfer to nitrocellulose membrane.

Membrane Blocking and Antibody Incubations
NOTE: Volumes are for 10 cm x 10 cm (100 cm2) of membrane; for different sized membranes, adjust volumes accordingly.

1. (Optional) After transfer, wash nitrocellulose membrane with 25 ml TBS for 5 min at room temperature.
2. Incubate membrane in 25 ml of blocking buffer for 1 hr at room temperature.
3. Wash three times for 5 min each with 15 ml of TBST.

Primary Antibody Incubation
Proceed to one of the following specific set of steps depending on the primary antibody used.

Unconjugated Primary Antibodies
1. Incubate membrane and primary antibody (at the appropriate dilution and diluent as recommended in the product datasheet) in 10 ml primary antibody dilution buffer with gentle agitation overnight at 4°C.
2. Wash three times for 5 min each with 15 ml of TBST.
3. Incubate membrane with the species appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (at1:2000) and anti-biotin, HRP-linked Antibody (1:1000–1:3000) to detect biotinylated protein markers in 10 ml of blocking buffer with gentle agitation for 1 hr at room temperature.
4. Wash three times for 5 min each with 15 ml of TBST.
5. Proceed with detection.

HRP Conjugated Primary Antibodies
1. Incubate membrane and primary antibody (at the appropriate dilution as recommended in the product datasheet) in 10 ml primary antibody dilution buffer with gentle agitation overnight at 4°C.
2. Wash three times for 5 min each with 15 ml of TBST.
3. Incubate with Anti-biotin, HRP-linked Antibody (1:1000–1:3000), to detect biotinylated protein markers, in 10 ml of blocking buffer with gentle agitation for 1 hr at room temperature.
4. Wash three times for 5 min each with 15 ml of TBST.
5. Proceed with detection.

Biotinylated Primary Antibodies
1. Incubate membrane and primary antibody (at the appropriate dilution as recommended in the product datasheet) in 10 ml primary antibody dilution buffer with gentle agitation overnight at 4°C.
2. Wash three times for 5 min each with 15 ml of TBST.
3. Incubate membrane with Streptavidin-HRP in 10 ml of blocking buffer with gentle agitation for 1 hr at room temperature.
4. Wash three times for 5 min each with 15 ml of TBST.
5. Proceed with detection.

Detection of Proteins
1. Incubate membrane with 10 ml LumiGLO (0.5 ml 20X LumiGLO, 0.5 ml 20X Peroxide, and 9.0 ml purified water) or 10 ml SignalFire (5 ml Reagent A, 5 ml Reagent B) with gentle agitation for 1 min at room temperature.
2. Drain membrane of excess developing solution (do not let dry), wrap in plastic wrap and expose to x-ray film. An initial 10 sec exposure should indicate the proper exposure time. NOTE: Due to the kinetics of the detection reaction, signal is most intense immediately following incubation and declines over the following 2 hr.
